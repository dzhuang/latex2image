### A Dockerized Service Converting LaTeX code to images

Often, when we want to convert a LaTeX scripts to images (which is beyond the reach of MathJax), it is hard to configure 
the LaTeX compile environment. This project provide a Dockerized service which can be deployed within minutes,  with a 
minimal disk space usage (no more than 1 GB).

## Install and Usage
Setup a MongoDB in you computer with default port (27017) opened, then run the following in your command line console:
    
    docker pull dzhuang/latex2image:latest

    git clone https://github.com/dzhuang/latex2image.git
    cd latex2image

    cp docker-compose-example.yml docker-compose.yml
    vi docker-compose.yml # Change your configurations

    docker-compose up -d

In your browser, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8020/, and login with the superuser name you configured in the 
`docker-compose.yml` (see below).

#### Notice:
- Using a [dockerized](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) mongodb will make it even simpler.
- `tex_key`s are auto generated if not provided in the form view, or via the `POST` request in API views. 
It will be stored as the key of the generated result (either the `image` or the `compile_error` )in the database, 
as well as in the cache, and as the base_name of the image file generated. The key can be used to do the GET, POST, 
PUT, PATCH and DELETE with the API requests.
- No LaTeX source code will be saved in the database.
- Make sure your TeX code will compile to only one pdf page, or it will raise errors.

## Configurations

The following short-handed settings can be configured in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

| Django Settings/Environment Variable | Detail                               |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| L2I_SECRET_KEY | The [SECRET_KEY](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#secret-key) of your server. You need to configure this to keep you data safe.|
| L2I_ALLOWED_HOST_*                  | A host which is to be appended to `settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS` |
| L2I_MONGODB_HOST                   | The host name of the mongodb used  |
| L2I_MONGO_DB_NAME  | The mongodb database name you prefer. If not set, `latex2image` will be used. |
| L2I_MONGODB_USERNAME                 | The username of mongodb used. If not set, it will not be set.   |
| L2I_MONGODB_PASSWORD                 | The passwd of mongodb used.   |
| L2I_CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST_*          | The allowed hosts which will not be checked by CSRF requests especially for API requests. (Notice, need to add `http:\\` or `https:\\` as prefix.) |
| L2I_LANGUAGE_CODE                  | [Language code](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-LANGUAGE_CODE) used for web server.              |
| L2I_TZ                     | Timezone used.|
| L2I_DEBUG                  | For settings.DEBUG. Allowed values [`off`, `on`], default to `off`. | 
| L2I_API_IMAGE_RETURNS_RELATIVE_PATH | By default, when the return result of API request, the image field will return the relative path of the image file in the storage. If you want it to return the absolute url of the image, set it to `False`, which also need a proper configuration of the `MEDIA_URL` in your local_settings.|
| L2I_CACHE_MAX_BYTES | The maximum size above which the attribute won't be cached. |
| L2I_CACHE_DATA_URL_ON_SAVE | Whether cache the `data_url` attribute when a `LatexImage` object is saved. |
| L2I_KEY_VERSION | A string which will be concatenated in the auto-generated `tex_key`, which is used as the identifier of the Tex source code. Default to 1. |
| L2I_USE_EXISTING_STORAGE_IMAGE_TO_CREATE_INSTANCE | Default to False. If an / all instance(s) were deleted while the image(s) were not delete from the default storage, you can set the option to `True` to prevent re-compile / re-convert the image(s), and use the image(s) to recreate the instance when requested. This is important when we were serving images on cloud storages like s3 while the database were destroyed. In this way, we don't need to regenerate and upload the image(s).|
| DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME | Superuser name created for the first run. String, no quote. |
| DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD | Superuser password created for the first run. String, no quote. |

### Advanced Configurations

You can map the folder `latex2image/local_settings` to your local machine in the `volumes` block, and write a file named `local_settings.py` in it
to override all setting items (including those set in the `docker-compose.yml` file). Another assumption which makes you need to use the `local_settings.py`
configurations is, the docker service assume there is a running MongoDB service with 27017 port opened. You can override that by using SQLite3 backends,
but make sure you have correct volume map of that sqlite3 file, or you data will get lost when the container stops.

### APIs available

The APIs are realized by [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). The Token authorization were used to authorize requests, when token available for each user
in their `\profile` page. When requesting via APIs, you need to add a header `Authorization` with value `Token <your/given/token>`.

| URL | Allowed method      |
|-----|---------------------|
| api/create | POST |
| api/detail/<tex_key> | GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE |
| api/list | GET/POST |  

- `POST` data:
  - `tex_source`: string, required.
  - `image_format`: string, required. Allowed format include `png` and `svg`, when `png` will return a png image with 
  resolution 96.
  - `compiler`: string, required. Allowed compiler include `latex`, `pdflatex`, `xelatex` and `lualatex`. Notice that
  when `compiler` is `latex` while the source code contains `tikz` pictures, it will return `svg` images disregarding 
  the `image_format` param.
  - `tex_key`: Optional, a unique identifier, if not provide, it will be generated automatically. Notice that, the image generated will use that key as the base_name.
  - `use_existing_storage_image_to_create_instance`: Optional, defaults to   
  - `fields`: Optional, a string with fields name concatenated by `,`. See below.

- For `POST` requests, with a `fields` (e.g., {`fields`: `image,creator`}) in the post data, you'll get a result which don't display all the fields. When only on field is specified, the result will be cached.
- For `GET` requests, result fields filtering is achieved by adding a querystring (`?fields=image,creator`).

### Cache
By default, when requesting a single field, via `?fields=<field_name>` in GET or a field name in post data via {"fields": field_name}, the result will be cached.
For example, if you have a record with:

        {tex_key: "abcd_xelatex_svg_v1",
         image: "l2i_images/abcd_xelatex_svg_v1.svg",
         creator: 1,
         creation_time: 2020-06-25:16:56,
         compile_error: None
         }

When `GET` that result with `api/detail/abcd_xelatex_svg_v1?fields="image"`, the result will be cached, i.e., querying using a single field, the result will be cached, else the results are returned from db queries.
Noticing that, if the `compile_error` is not null, it will be returned in the data, with response code 400.

For `POST` request,  if you want a field to be cached and returned, you need to add `fields` in the post data (it is also the same for `PUT`). 


### Extra packages

If you need to install more Python packages, you can map the folder `latex2image/local_settings` to a local folder, and
put a `requirements.txt` in it.
